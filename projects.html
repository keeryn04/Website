                            <p>This is the first engineering project I worked on during my university career. The project included 3D printing an outer shell, coding the Arduino to control timing of the lights and watering, and wiring the system together.</p>

                            <p>My second engineering project was a handheld game console, which ran fully off an Arduino Uno and 2 AA batteries. We had to design a game to go along with the console, which came with the struggle of portable power that the Arduino had.</p>

                               which supplied input/output access through the terminal and established a class-based
                               system as to allow modularity and easier code repair.</p>

                            <p>My next major project was a Java developed Disaster Relief Application, 
                               which used GUI inputs to manipulate a database storing information about
                               families effected by a disaster, shelter info. Through the use of classes, 
                               the project was established as a modular, complex system that followed aspects 
                               of OOP programming rules.</p>

                            <h3>Full Stack Website</h3>
                            <p>My longest project involved the full stack development process, from HTML basics to
                               reimplementation in an efficient React-based application, I created an online shopping website capable 
                               of handling front-end inputs from the user and back end storage of their data. With inputs such as 
                               login info and choice of items to buy, the user can store that info in their specific account and access it
                               for every purchase.

                            <p>This project is built in to this website, and uses an API call to OMDb API by Brian Fritz to access movie data.
                               It uses this API call to search a specified title from the user and returns data such as rating, genre, summary, 
                               and much more! To test it out, click on the title of this section or go to Movie Matcher in the navigation bar.
